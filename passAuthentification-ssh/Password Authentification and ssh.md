# GitHub SSH Authentication Issue

The error message you're seeing is because GitHub has discontinued support for password authentication when interacting with repositories. You'll need to use a personal access token (PAT) or SSH keys for authentication.

Since you mentioned you're using SSH and it's still asking for your username and password, it's possible that your repository's remote URL is using the HTTPS format. You can check this by running `git remote -v` in your repository's directory. If the URL starts with `https://`, it's using HTTPS.

To switch to SSH, you'll need to change the remote URL to the SSH format. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Change the current working directory to your local repository.
3. List your existing remotes in order to get the name of the remote you want to change.

```bash
git remote -v
```

4. Change your remote's URL from HTTPS to SSH with the `git remote set-url` command.

`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git`

Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username, and `REPOSITORY` with the name of your GitHub repository.

5. Verify that the remote URL has changed.

`git remote -v`

Now, you should be able to push changes to GitHub using SSH. If you're still having issues, make sure you've added your SSH key to your GitHub account and that your SSH agent is running.

Please replace `USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

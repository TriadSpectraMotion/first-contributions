# Updated Images for README

This directory contains updated HTML mockups for the GitHub interface images used in the README.

Since we can't directly generate the images through Puppeteer in this environment, here's what we need to do:

1. Open the HTML files in a browser
2. Take screenshots of the rendered pages
3. Save them as PNG files with the same names as the original images
4. Update the README.md to use these new images

## Steps to manually generate images:

1. Open `compare-and-pull.html` in a browser
2. Take a screenshot of the page
3. Save it as `compare-and-pull.png`
4. Open `submit-pull-request.html` in a browser
5. Take a screenshot of the page
6. Save it as `submit-pull-request.png`
7. Move these images to a public location (e.g., GitHub repo assets)
8. Update the README.md to point to these new images

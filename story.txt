A CSE student, starting with zero coding background in his first year, began by learning the basics of programming through online tutorials and college courses. He gradually built his skills by practicing daily on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, often struggling but never giving up. Over time, he joined coding clubs, participated in hackathons, and collaborated on open-source projects, which boosted his confidence and teamwork skills. In his final year, he focused intensely on FAANG interview prep, tackling hundreds of data structures and algorithms problems, mock interviews, and system design questions. After months of relentless practice, he finally cracked the toughest interview rounds and received an offer as an SD1 at a FAANG company, turning his journey from a complete beginner to a top-tier software engineer into reality.
